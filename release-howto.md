This repo uses the [gradle-release plugin](https://github.com/researchgate/gradle-release), which is configured to build a fat jar.
To do a release, run `gradle release`, follow the instructions, then upload the resulting fat jar (in build/libs) to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/CedricReichenbach/audiomerge/releases).
